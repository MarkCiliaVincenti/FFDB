update logging


- ffdb.data project to pull data from (zip file + single files fetches)

- initial setup should have an option/flag to ONLY setup db stuff (schema + tables, NO stats updates or anything)
- update logging to make use of serilog structured formatting - use json formatting too when relevant
	- for ex, when starting up, display the program options as json
- logging setup/config should allow custom msg formatting template
- simplify logging level setup. Should default to INFO, with a "verbose" flag to set it to DEBUG mode
	- this means ALL logging should use either info/debug (unless warning/except)




update access modifiers to as restrictive as needed (mainly public -> internal)
-unit & functional tests for everything
- documentation
- get image/diagram of db schemas (both mongo and postgres) for alpha release discussion
