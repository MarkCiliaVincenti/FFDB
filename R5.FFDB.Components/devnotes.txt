getting player's team history on a week by week basis:

use NFL player profiles gamelogs pages:
http://www.nfl.com/player/demaryiusthomas/497328/gamelogs
http://www.nfl.com/player/demaryiusthomas/497328/gamelogs?season=2017   for random teams, omitting season takes you to latest

on the RESULT column, it has a link (with text score), and the last segment of the URL
indicates the two teams that have played

The previous column, opponent, can be used to derive which team the player was on 
eg:
demaryius thomas, 2018, week3:
opp: @ BAL
Result: L 14-27, where the link uri is:
   http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018092301/2018/REG3/broncos@ravens

we know he was on the broncos for this game because the opp was specified as BAL

we'll need to add a prop to all teams, "short name"? that maps to "broncos@ravens" these values

-- watch out for bye weeks
      the second col, game date, sshows dates, but if it shows BYE, make sure to log it as such
