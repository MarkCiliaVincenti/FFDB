current plan: provide direct support for 2 databases (Postgres and Mongo)
each should simply be its own library/package that provides the necesary DatabaseProvider<TDbContext>

the engine, during setup/config, needs to either select one of the built-in ones, OR optionally accept any random one.
This allows users to customize and create their own, and possibly have community built db providers for other databases like sql server, etc. !!

each db provider would obvioisly have their own DB models/classes, so their projects
would need to handle those as well. Anything on the interfaces would reference
the core FFDB models.
