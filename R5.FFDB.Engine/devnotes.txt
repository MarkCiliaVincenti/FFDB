TODOS:
- try catch everywhere for better error messages
- use file error more liberally in certain areas where it'd be useful
	these logs can later be used dynamically to augment the engines run behavior

- WAY LATER: run engine as background service! need to allow setup via config file to reference b/c its a svc


- Reporting feature. Every time a command is run, save a report as a json file
   - InitialSetup-DATE.json
   - Update-DATE.json
   etc..

- scrapers should all be injected to IOC for logging
- health checks for all sources
- other update types, like by week, season?
- update static info, like player profiles based on roster scraping
- team game history information, like which games were played on a week, and the results

- depth chart?

- validation of db provider configs (and other configs)

--- sources should ALWAYS skip fetching IF the file already exists.
------- for temp data, we'll provide an option to clear temp files BEFORE updates are run
