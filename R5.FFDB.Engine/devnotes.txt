TODOS:
- try catch everywhere for better error messages
- use file error more liberally in certain areas where it'd be useful
	these logs can later be used dynamically to augment the engines run behavior

- WAY LATER: run engine as background service! need to allow setup via config file to reference b/c its a svc
